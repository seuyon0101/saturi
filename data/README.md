# DATA
---
We used public data available in AIHUB(aihub.or.kr) to train our model.
Because we did not have English pair for each dialect, we translated all of our data using a pretrained model.

### how to get access to data for this project
Most of raw data has been acquired from public API data. However given the size of the data and model checkpoint files, we saved our files in our private drives.
